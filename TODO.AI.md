## Pre-existing `script-lint` violations found 2026-09-13 (centos->rhel rename sweep)

Surfaced incidentally while updating hardcoded `casjay-base/centos`/
`pkmgr/centos` URLs to `casjay-base/rhel`/`pkmgr/rhel` — confirmed via
`git diff` that these predate this edit (only the URL lines changed).
Re-run `script-lint` for exact current line numbers before fixing.

- [ ] scripts/{arch,centos,debian,fedora,macos,void}.sh: grep calls
      missing `--` before the query pattern; template functions missing
      required `__` prefix
